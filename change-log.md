- **README**: Updated test and coverage badges (321 tests, 74% coverage)
- **Test Fixes**: Fixed CLI tests to use correct `load_config` patching

### Fixed
- Fixed CLI test failures by correcting mock patches (`Config.from_file` → `load_config`)
- All 323 tests now passing (up from 321)

### Status
- ✅ **323 tests passing** with **75% coverage**
- ✅ **All code quality checks passing**

## [Unreleased - CLI Fix] - 2025-11-18

### Fixed - Critical CLI Authentication Issue
- **X-Tenant-ID Header**: Fixed missing tenant ID header in regional API requests
  - Added `tenant_id` parameter to `HTTPClient` and `HTTPClientSync`
  - Updated all CLI commands to pass tenant ID from whoami response
  - Regional endpoints now work correctly (e.g., api-eu01.central.sophos.com)
  
- **Pydantic Model Validation**:
  - Made `AssociatedPerson.id` field optional (Linux endpoints don't always provide it)
  - Made `OSInfo` version fields optional (majorVersion, minorVersion, build)
  - Made `PageInfo` current/total fields optional (cursor pagination doesn't provide them)
  
- **JSON Serialization**: 
  - Fixed datetime serialization in CLI output by using `model_dump(mode="json")`
  - Applied fix to all CLI commands (endpoint, alerts, tenants, admins, roles)

- **CLI Functionality**: Implemented `config test` command
  - Tests OAuth2 token acquisition
  - Tests whoami endpoint
  - Provides detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Changed
- **HTTPClient**: Now accepts optional `tenant_id` parameter for regional API calls
- **HTTPClientSync**: Now accepts optional `tenant_id` parameter for regional API calls
- **Core Models**: Several fields made optional to match actual API responses

### Status
- ✅ CLI is now **fully functional** with real API integration
- ✅ All 244 tests passing with 70% coverage
- ✅ Authentication working correctly for all endpoints
- ✅ JSON, CSV, and table output formats working

### Deferred
- Integration tests (would require 20-30 additional tests)
- End-to-end CLI tests (would require 15-20 additional tests)
- Performance benchmarks (would require 5-10 tests)
- Additional coverage to reach 90%+ (would require significant additional development time)
